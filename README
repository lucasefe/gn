GN(1)

NAME
      gn -- The simplest template generator.

SYNOPSIS
      gn <plan>
      gn -i <plan-url>
      gn -h

DESCRIPTION
      <plan>
          Opens the blueprints with the default editor, and once saved
          it expands the templates.

      -i <plan-url>
          Installs the given plan from a git repository. It clones the
          repository to ~/.gn/<plan>.

      -h
          Display this help message.

EXAMPLE PLAN
      A plan is a directory in ~/.gn/<plan>, with the following
      structure:

          ~/.gn/<plan>/plan.rb
          ~/.gn/<plan>/plan/<template>.mote

      For example, consider a plan for generating a gemspec file.

          ~/.gn/gemspec/plan.rb
          ~/.gn/gemspec/plan/gemspec.mote

      The plan definition `plan.rb` has this format:

          module Plan
            class GemSpec
              def name
                "foo"
              end

              def version
                "0.0.1"
              end

              def description
                "Description of my gem"
              end

              def authors
                ["My Name"]
              end

              def email
                ["my_name@example.com"]
              end

              def homepage
                "http://example.com/"
              end

              def license
                "MIT"
              end

              def destination
                "#{name}.gemspec"
              end
            end
          end

      The only mandatory method is `destination`. Everything else is
      optional and is based on how the template is designed.

      Templates are rendered using mote (http://soveran.github.com/mote),
      the minimalist template engine. Variable interpolation is
      done by using the {{variable}} syntax, as shown in the example
      below. Variable names are extracted from the plan context, in this
      case an instance of `Plan::GemSpec`.

          # encoding: utf-8

          Gem::Specification.new do |s|
            s.name              = "{{name}}"
            s.version           = "{{version}}"
            s.summary           = "{{description}}"
            s.description       = "{{description}}"
            s.authors           = {{authors.inspect}}
            s.email             = {{email.inspect}}
            s.homepage          = "{{homepage}}"
            s.files             = []
            s.license           = "{{license}}"
            # s.executables.push(<executable>)
            # s.add_dependency <dependency>, <version>
          end

      Refer to the advanced example for information about how to
      generate different files and directory structures.

ADVANCED EXAMPLE
      It is possible to use gn to generate several files and even
      complex directory structures. Consider this plan definition:

          $ find .gn/foo
          .gn/foo//plan.rb
          .gn/foo//plan/foo.mote
          .gn/foo//plan/bar/baz.mote

          $ cat plan.rb
          module Plan
            class Foo
              def destination
                "foo.rb"
              end
            end

            module Bar
              class Bar
                def destination
                  "bar/baz.rb"
                end
              end
            end
          end

DSL USAGE
      Define your plan like this:

          require 'gn/dsl'

          module Plan
            extend Gn::DSL

            template "App", "app.rb"
          end

      Or you can provide additional methods in a block:

          require 'gn/dsl'

          module Plan
            extend Gn::DSL

            template "App", "app.rb" do
              def name
                "My App Name"
              end
            end
          end

EDITING A PLAN
      When using a template, gn gives you the ability to edit the plan
      before running it. Only the templates that correspond to classes
      defined in the Plan module get expanded and written. It means
      that if you want to create only the file `foo.rb` in the example
      above, all you have to do is delete the Bar module from the plan
      definition.

INSTALLATION
      $ gem install gn

HISTORY
      In software development, there's usually the need to generate
      code or directory structures, and many tools have this feature
      built in. The idea with gn is to provide a small and simple tool
      that generalizes the task of template expansion in a way that's
      easy to understand, yet powerful and flexible.
